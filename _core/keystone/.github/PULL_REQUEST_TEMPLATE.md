 Notes:

 * To successfully have all e2e tests pass you need to have the following setup:
    - a recent version of the chrome browser
    - java 1.8+
 * If you are developing in Windows you may run into linebreak linting issues.
   One possible workaround is to remove the "linebreak-style" rule in `node_modules/eslint-config-keystone/eslintrc.json`.
